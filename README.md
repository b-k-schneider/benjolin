the files included benjolin's bom, panel and schmeatic. 
here's the modifications i made:
* an external audio input to filter
* the pitch is voltage controllable in both oscillator
* the frequency of low pass filter is voltage controllable
* disconnect t2 to filter (you can still use cable to connect t2 to filter's cv input)
