# modifications
* an external audio input to filter
* the pitch is voltage controllable in both oscillator
* the frequency of low pass filter is voltage controllable
* disconnect t2 to filter (you can still use cable to connect t2 to filter's cv input)
* add a spst to switch the current input(p1 or -9~9v voltage with a potentiometer) to bc547 

# voltage
* tri1 out: ~6Vpp
* pul1 out: ~12Vpp
* tri2 out: ~6Vpp
* pul2 out: ~12Vpp
* pwm out: ~18Vpp
* main out: ~2Vpp
