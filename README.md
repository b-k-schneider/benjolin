# benjolin
* this is a diy eurorack project based on rob hordijk's benjolin 

![alt tag](https://https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15021145/16653856/99682310-4485-11e6-91bf-216e7747f427.jpg)

the files included benjolin's bom, panel and schmeatic with some modifications, 
e.g. an external audio input to filter, the pitch is voltage controllable in both oscillator and disconnect t2 to filter. (you can still use cable to connect t2 to filter's cv input)

thanks rob's permission allows me to run the benjolin's pcb in eurorack, benjolin is a gift to the diy synth community and I am truly grateful for his dedication.
